<h2 id="wikis_mailing_lists">Wikis and mailing lists</h2>

NESCent has provided a wiki and mailing list for all NESCent working groups and catalysis meeting. You can search the list of wikis and mailing lists on the [NESCent website](https://nescent.org/wikis).

<h3>MediaWiki sites</h3>
If your group started before 2012, you probably have a MediaWiki site. These are the wikis that look like Wikipedia; see [an example](http://informatics.nescent.org/wiki/Main_Page)). These are hosted at NESCent and will go offline in summer 2015. Unfortunately, it is not possible to simply save an entire MediaWiki site in a human-readable form. Here are some options (warning: none of them are good options, and all require some computational skill):

* We can provide an XML dump from which the wiki can be reconstituted either on your own server or using a [hosting service](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Hosting_services). 
* You can manually save a printable version of any page by clicking on the *Printable version* link in the sidebar
* You can manually save the wikitext of any page by clicking on *edit* at the top of the page, copying and pasting the text in the box. 

MediaWiki has a [list of parsers](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Alternative_parsers) for converting from XML and wikitext into other formats. For wikitext, we recommend [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) or pasting the content into a [GitHub wiki](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/).

<h3>Wikispaces sites</h3>
If your group started after 2012, you probably have a Wikispaces site (see [an example](http://opentree.wikispaces.com/)). These sites are hosted at wikispaces under their free educational plan, so they will **not** disappear once NESCent closes. If you are not already an organizer of you Wikispaces site (check wiki-name.wikispaces.com/Members), we will promote you. Then, you have full control over your site. To download an archive of the site (included uploaded files), go to Settings->Exports/Backups (URL is wiki-name.wikispaces.com/export/list). For more information, see the [Wikispaces Help](http://help.wikispaces.com/). 

<h3>Mailing lists</h3>
Some groups (generally those with MediaWiki sites, but not Wikispaces) also had separate mailing lists. These lists will not longer be accessible once NESCent closes. We can provide the membership of the list and an archive of all email correspondence, in HTML with one message per HTML page.

<h2 id="dscr">DSCR accounts</h2>
If you had an account on the [Duke Shared Cluster Resource](https://wiki.duke.edu/display/SCSC/DSCR), you will need to move the files in your home directory to another location (noting that the DSCR was never to be a permanent home for data). All accounts on the DSCR need to be associated with an existing campus group, so unless you have another affiliation on Duke campus, your account will be deleted once NESCent closes.

<h2 id="source_code">Source code</h2>
All NESCent source code is open source and available from the [NESCent GitHub organization](https://github.com/nescent), which will remain online after NESCent closes.  We also provide a [summary of all NESCent repositories]( {{"/repositories"|prepend: site.baseurl }} ). 

<h2 id="nescent_website">NESCent website</h2>
Duke will continue to host the NESCent website for at least X years after NESCent closes. In addition, we will place an archive of the site at the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/).

<h2 id="hosted_apps">Hosted applications</h2>
If NESCent hosts an application that is the product of your NESCent project, you should have already received an email about transferring that application to another institution and / or sending an archive of the data. All source code for NESCent-hosted application is open source and available from the [NESCent GitHub organization](https://github.com/nescent).
