<h2 id="wikis_mailing_lists">Wikis and mailing lists</h2>

NESCent has provided a wiki and mailing list for all NESCent working groups and catalysis meeting. You can search the list of wikis and mailing lists on the [NESCent website](https://nescent.org/wikis).

<h3>MediaWiki sites</h3>
These are the wikis that look l</h2>ike Wikipedia; see [an example](http://informatics.nescent.org/wiki/Main_Page)). We can provide a set of HTML pages that can be read in a web browser. If you have the ability to install MediaWiki on your own servers, we can provide a dump that can be re-installed. 

<h3>Wikispaces sites</h3>
If your group started after 2010, you probably have a Wikispaces site (see [an example](http://opentree.wikispaces.com/)). These sites are hosted at wikispaces under their free educational plan, so they will not disappear once NESCent closes. If you are not already an organizer of you Wikispaces site (check wiki-name.wikispaces.com/Members), we will promote you. Then, you have full control over your site. To download an archive of the site (included uploaded files), go to Settings->Exports/Backups (URL is wiki-name.wikispaces.com/export/list). For more information, see the [Wikispaces Help](http://help.wikispaces.com/).

<h2 id="dscr">DSCR accounts</h2>
If you had an account on the Duke Shared Cluster Resource, you will need to move the files in your home directory to another location (noting that the DSCR was never to be a permanent home for data). All accounts on the DSCR need to be associated with an existing campus group, so unless you have another affilication on Duke campus, your account will be deleted once NESCent closes.

<h2 id="source_code">Source code</h2>
All NESCent source code is open source and available from the [NESCent GitHub organization](https://github.com/nescent). We also provide a [summary of all NESCent repositories]( {{"/repositories"|prepend: site.baseurl }} ). 

<h2 id="hosted_apps">Hosted applications</h2>
If NESCent hosts an application that is the product of your NESCent project, you should have already received an email about transferring that application to another institution and / or sending an archive of the data. All source code is on the [NESCent GitHub organization](https://github.com/nescent).
