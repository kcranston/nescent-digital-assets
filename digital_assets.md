If you had a wiki, mailing list, Duke Cluster account or other online resource through NESCent, this page describes what will happen to that resource when NESCent closes and how to access your data before then.

## Wikis and mailing lists

NESCent has provided a wiki and mailing list for all NESCent working groups and catalysis meeting. You can search the list of wikis and mailing lists on the [NESCent website](https://nescent.org/wikis).

* MediaWiki sites (the wikis that look like Wikipedia; see [an example](http://informatics.nescent.org/wiki/Main_Page)): we can provide a set of HTML pages that can be read in a web browser. If you have the ability to install MediaWiki on your own servers, we can provide a dump that can be re-installed. 
* Wikispaces sites (see [an example](http://opentree.wikispaces.com/)): these are hosted for at wikispaces under their free educational plan, so they will not disappear once NESCent closes.

## DSCR accounts
If you had an account on the Duke Shared Cluster Resource, you will need to move the files in your home directory to another location (noting that the DSCR was never to be a permanent home for data). All accounts on the DSCR need to be associated with an existing campus group, so unless you have another affilication on Duke campus, your account will be deleted once NESCent closes.

## Source code
All NESCent source code is open source and available from the [NESCent GitHub organization](https://github.com/nescent).

## Hosted applications
If NESCent hosts an application that is the product of your NESCent project, you should have already received an email about transferring that application to another institution and / or sending an archive of the data. All source code is on the [NESCent GitHub organization](https://github.com/nescent).
