title: NESCent is closing
---

The National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) has had 10 years of funding from the [National Science Foundation](http://nsf.gov). The program that funds synthesis centers does not provide funding beyond 10 years, and NESCent will close its doors in July 2015. 

Over the past 10 years, NESCent and NESCent scientists have created many websites, datasets, software packages and other online content. This site describes this content and plans for archival and handoff.
